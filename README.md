how to use. Browse first your osu! songs folder, then on keybinds type example: F4 and F11 to the keybinds, then set said keybinds, 
and then you can use the program while in osu! When you download new beatmaps from Direct, etc., it deletes the background. Hit F5 to refresh osu! songs after.
Simply launch .exe and enjoy!
